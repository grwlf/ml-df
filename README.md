ML-DF
=====

The goal of this project is self-education. I'll implement the minimal ML-like
parser, just as @bionic originally did in his ML-W project
https://github.com/bitonic/ml-w

Later, I plan to learn the Defunctionalisation technic using
http://www.brics.dk/RS/01/23/BRICS-RS-01-23.pdf
as a reference.

The language is not functioning yet. Sample programs to be parsed are in tests/
folder.
